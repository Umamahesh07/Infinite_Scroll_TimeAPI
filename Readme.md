# Infinite Scroll - TimeAPI Method

Using the TimeAPI method, we demonstrate infinite scrolling by fetching and displaying the current time for a specific timezone whenever the user reaches the end of the content. This provides a real-world use case of how infinite scrolling can be combined with API requests.

## Implementation Overview

1. **Initial Page Load**:
   - On the initial page load, a predetermined number of time entries are fetched and displayed to ensure the page is scrollable.

2. **Event Listener for Scrolling**:
   - A jQuery event listener is set up to monitor the window's scroll event and determine when a user has scrolled to the bottom of the content.

3. **Fetching Time Data**:
   - Upon nearing the end of the content, the current time for a specific timezone (e.g., EST) is fetched multiple times using the TimeAPI, and then displayed on the page.

4. **Dynamic Time Display**:
   - Each fetched time entry is dynamically created as a DOM element and appended to the page, displaying the current date and time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Fetching**: By integrating with the TimeAPI, real-time data can be fetched and displayed, showcasing how infinite scrolling can be combined with live data requests.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users receive fresh data continuously as they scroll, without any interruptions or need for manual refresh.

- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Data is fetched in chunks as the user scrolls, ensuring that only the necessary amount of data is loaded, improving performance and reducing unnecessary API calls.

## How to Use

1. Load the HTML page in a browser.
2. Scroll downwards. As you approach the end of the content, fresh time entries will automatically be added.
3. Witness the continuous stream of current time data!
